Hey! 👋

I'm Shichiha 🐝, a hobbyist who spends their time learning 🖥️ new technologies and 🎈 building cool stuff. 

I'm currently a High School student aiming to become a full-stack developer. 🧑‍💻

That being said, I haven't made much.

here are some of the projects that I've made in the past.

## What I'm most known for (probably) 😉
