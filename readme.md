# 00sh 🔥
Personal Blog-like (but not really) website built with 11ty (with [Markdown](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), [Pug](https://pugjs.org), and [Indented Sass](https://sass-lang.com/))

## Development 
Run `npm i` (in my case, `pnpm i`) to download all the dev-dependencies
### Building the site
Run `npm run build`, it will output the HTML, CSS files to the `_site` folder.

### Serving Development Server
Run `npm run dev`, it will build and serve files from: `_site` externally and locally on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) (on default) and rebuild it every time you make a change to any file in `src`
